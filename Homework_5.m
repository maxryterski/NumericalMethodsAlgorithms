function [A] = specialMatrix(n,m)
% This function should return a matrix A as described in the problem statement
% Inputs n is the number of rows, and m the number of columns
% It is recomended to first create the matrxix A of the correct size, filling it with zeros to start with is not a bad choice
A = n * m

% Now the real challenge is to fill in the correct values of A


end
% Things beyond here are outside of your function
